# CJAY
An InMoov Humanoid Robot me and my team built at university. 

CJAY is an acronym of the team members:
Chandan Dhamande --> @nitrogen.404
Jyoti Dingley 
Ayush Taunk
Yashwardhan Dixit --> krypto-kiddo

CJAY is basically an implementation of the French Open Source Humanoid Robot originally called InMoov.  (www.inmoov.fr)

" InMoov is the first Open Source 3D printed life-size robot. Replicable on any home 3D printer with a 12x12x12cm area, it is conceived as a development platform for Universities, Laboratories, Hobbyist, but first of all for Makers.
Itâ€™s concept, based on sharing and community, gives him the honor to be reproduced for countless projects through out the world. " - Inmoov.fr

This repo was built to maintian the documentation of the project. (I know we could've done it better on some other platform, but this would like increase the commitment grid on my profile xD)
Plus, its just basically images and text only so I might as well get it done on github as well.
